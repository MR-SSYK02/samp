1. Arithmetic Operators
These operators perform mathematical operations.

Operator	Description	Example
+	Addition	5 + 3 (8)
-	Subtraction	5 - 3 (2)
*	Multiplication	5 * 3 (15)
/	Division	5 / 2 (2.5)
%	Modulus (Remainder)	5 % 2 (1)
**	Exponentiation	2 ** 3 (8)
2. Assignment Operators
Used to assign values to variables.

Operator	Description	Example
=	Assigns a value	x = 10
+=	Adds and assigns	x += 5 (15)
-=	Subtracts and assigns	x -= 5 (5)
*=	Multiplies and assigns	x *= 5 (50)
/=	Divides and assigns	x /= 2 (25)
%=	Modulus and assigns	x %= 3 (1)
**=	Exponentiation and assigns	x **= 2 (4)
3. Comparison Operators
Used to compare two values.

Operator	Description	Example
==	Equal to (loose equality)	5 == "5" (true)
===	Strictly equal to	5 === "5" (false)
!=	Not equal to	5 != 3 (true)
!==	Strictly not equal to	5 !== "5" (true)
<	Less than	5 < 10 (true)
>	Greater than	5 > 3 (true)
<=	Less than or equal to	5 <= 5 (true)
>=	Greater than or equal to	5 >= 3 (true)
4. Logical Operators
Used for logical operations.

Operator	Description	Example
&&	Logical AND	true && false (false)
`		`
!	Logical NOT	!true (false)
5. Bitwise Operators
Operate on binary numbers.

Operator	Description	Example
&	AND	5 & 1 (1)
`	`	OR
^	XOR	5 ^ 1 (4)
~	NOT	~5 (-6)
<<	Left shift	5 << 1 (10)
>>	Right shift	5 >> 1 (2)
>>>	Zero-fill right shift	5 >>> 1 (2)
6. String Operators
Operate on strings.

Operator	Description	Example
+	Concatenation	"Hello " + "World" ("Hello World")
+=	Concatenation assignment	x += "World"
7. Ternary (Conditional) Operator
Shortcut for if-else statements.

Operator	Description	Example
? :	Condition evaluation	x > 5 ? "Yes" : "No"
8. Type Operators
Work with data types.

Operator	Description	Example
typeof	Returns the type	typeof 42 ("number")
instanceof	Checks instance	arr instanceof Array (true)
9. Nullish Coalescing Operator
Provides a default value if null or undefined.

Operator	Description	Example
??	Nullish coalescing	null ?? "default" ("default")
10. Optional Chaining Operator
Prevents errors when accessing deeply nested properties.

Operator	Description	Example
?.	Safe property access	obj?.prop

An API (Application Programming Interface) is a set of rules, protocols, and tools that allow software applications to communicate with each other. APIs are widely used to enable interaction between different software systems or services, making them essential in modern web development, app integration, and automation.

Key Features of an API
Interoperability: Facilitates communication between different systems, platforms, or applications.
Abstraction: Hides the complexity of the system by exposing only necessary functionality.
Standardization: Follows predefined standards to ensure compatibility.
Types of APIs
Web APIs (HTTP-based APIs):
Communicate over the web using HTTP.
Commonly used protocols: REST, GraphQL, SOAP.
Library APIs:
Provide functions or classes in a library for developers to use within their applications.
Operating System APIs:
Allow applications to interact with the OS features like file systems or hardware (e.g., Windows API, POSIX API).
Database APIs:
Enable interaction with databases (e.g., SQL queries, NoSQL APIs).
API Architectural Styles
REST (Representational State Transfer):

Stateless, uses standard HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE).
Data is typically returned in JSON or XML format.
Example:
http
Copy code
GET /api/users/1
SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol):

A protocol for exchanging structured information.
Uses XML and is more rigid than REST.
GraphQL:

Allows clients to specify the structure of the data they need.
A single endpoint is used for all requests.
Example:
graphql
Copy code
{
  user(id: 1) {
    name
    email
  }
}
WebSockets:

Enables two-way, real-time communication between a client and server.
Common in chat apps, live updates, etc.
Common API Terms
Endpoint:

A specific URL where an API resource can be accessed.
Example: https://api.example.com/users
Request and Response:

Request: Sent by the client to the server, usually includes method (e.g., GET, POST), headers, and data.
Response: Data sent by the server back to the client.
Authentication:

Ensures secure communication.
Common methods: API keys, OAuth tokens, JWT.
Rate Limiting:

Restricts the number of API requests a client can make in a given time frame.
How to Use an API
Read the Documentation:

Understand available endpoints, request formats, and expected responses.
Make a Request:

Use tools like Postman, cURL, or a programming language like JavaScript or Python.
Example in JavaScript:
javascript
Copy code
fetch('https://api.example.com/users/1')
  .then(response => response.json())
  .then(data => console.log(data));
Handle the Response:

Parse and use the returned data in your application.
